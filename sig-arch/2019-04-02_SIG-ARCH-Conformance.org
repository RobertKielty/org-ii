* Our Meeting Notes
  //Note: This is not a transcription, as that is done in the meeting notes, linked within [[Overview]]. So I will only notate that which seems of interest to our work with APISnoop//
** New Windows Image 
   - Claudiu put in PR for an image for testing that is host agnostic, for testing DNS. It needed to be reviewed by mutiple people. Tim St. Clair and Belamaric volunteered.
** De-Promotion of Conformance tests
   - Requires having same reviewers/approvers
   - Haven't really removed tests much, but have removed content from tests when it was no longer appropriate.
   - This came up because of the number of tests that are conformant, but not viable on windows.
   - The speaker wanted to also look at 'privilaged access tests'
** E2E Proposal: PR #76007
   - work being doen by globant, to write tests for these tcpSockets that are not curently covered.
   - Curious on the prcoess for getting it accepted.
   - Has to run through a few cycles, to make sure it is not flaky.
   - Also wanted to know who to talk to review that they are well-written tests.
** Review Walkthroughs
   - Worked back to front, from need approval to triage.
   - Much of the work was just assigning people, and knowing who to assign.
   - It was tough to find an ideal ticket to do the walkthrough as automation had not been done to assign tickets properly and better understand the process and such.
** Assigning Reviewers
   - Do we have the info we need to assign reviewers to the need review?
   - How do we loop in the new folks, and match to the technical understanding.
   - Any of us should be able to pick up one of these and go to the right people.
* Zach's Takeaway
  - Good question: 'How many conformance tests are privileged tests.  What are the plans for them what can we do about them?"  Can we use apisnoop to find this?
    - This might have already been taken care of though.
  - Review was a bit hard to track without the context for k8s, but interesting to see that there isn't an ingrained process for how to review/approve these.  There are guidelines, but even those are being iterated upon.
  - It seemed the biggest need for this group wasn't a look ato overall coverage, but help with the project board.  Which makes sense why that became a part of our roadmap.
