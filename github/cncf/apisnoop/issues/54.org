#+NAME: Issue 54

* Description
Consistent Positioning and Alignment of sections from top to botom of page

* Method
** Add padding to main container
   Everything is inside our Mainpage which acts as a container.  This page already has =pa4= or padding all around of 4. We can then remove the padding for the releases list, the sunburst section, and the tests section, and they should all be lined up.

   We have pa4 all around, and an additional mt4 between major sections.  This will provide necessary spacing i think.
   the sunburst has an additional pt4 and mt1 for the top headings, to make the 'switching to' item work.
