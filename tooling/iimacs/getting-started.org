* Installing Spacemacs
  We'll clone our special emacs setup to be your home directory's ~.emacs.d~
  If you already have an .emacs.d folder, first back it up:
: mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bk
  Then clone our repo to that directory
: git clone git@gitlab.ii.coop:ii/tooling/iimacs.git ~/.emacs.d


* Verifying it works
  these should be tests you can run that verify each of our unique features listed above.
