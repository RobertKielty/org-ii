Steps to setting up a Raspberry Pi to talk to a LimeSDR.

* Initial steps and dependencies
** Dependencies
- make
- git

** ScratchRadio
ScratchRadio is a library for Scratch which allows it to talk to a LimeSDR device.
The install scripts also install LimeSuite, which is what we'll be mostly using.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# prepare
mkdir -p ~/Documents/git
cd ~/Documents/git
git clone https://github.com/myriadrf/ScratchRadio
cd ScratchRadio

# setup
sudo ./scripts/install_deps.sh
make LimeSuite
make GnuRadio
make ScratchRadio
make clean
#+END_SRC

* Connection and accessing
Connecting to the SDR is done via raw/serial USB.

1. Plug the LimeSDR device into the Raspberry Pi, using the USB-A 3.0 ports if available
2. Launch `LimeSuiteGUI` 
3. Go to Options -> Connection Settings
4. Highlight the board and press Connect
