* Look at Cubic

I started with [[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-create-a-custom-ubuntu-iso-with-cubic/][a Tech Republic blog post on cubic]]
It was a pain to install on my box.
It uses Polkit to get root access.
So I had to run lxpolkit in another window.
Then it was eventually able to pop up a window.

** In the shell

DNS wasn't working due to symlinks.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mkdir -p /run/systemd/resolve
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 >> /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC 
 apt update -y
 apt install -y git curl wget sed
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface.git ~/linux-surface
 cd ~/linux-surface
 sudo sh setup.sh
#+END_SRC
* Look at Directly creating a LiveCD
[[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization#Live_CD_Kernel][Custom Live CD Kernel]]

We need to copy the kernel / initrd in place before we burn the ISO.
However I'm wondering if the initrd needs to be updated for use on the CDROM?

#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo cp ./squashfs-root/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.20-surface-linux-surface custom-live-iso/casper/vmlinuz
sudo cp ./squashfs-root/boot/initrd.img-4.18.20-surface-linux-surface ./custom-live-iso/casper/
#+END_SRC

In the end, while it has a nice gui, this wasn't going to result in a repeatable build.
