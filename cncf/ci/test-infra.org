*** Advanced GCR Auth
#+NAME: TLDR... to get docker to auth to *.gcr.io
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gcloud auth configure-docker
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: TLDR... to get docker to auth to *.gcr.io

So we try this approach:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
gcloud components install docker-credential-gcr
#+END_SRC

After I ensured that gcloud comes from the upstream url:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ERROR: (gcloud.components.install) 
The docker-credential-gcr component(s) is unavailable through the packaging system 
you are currently using. Please consider using a separate installation 
of the Cloud SDK created through the default mechanism described at: 

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/ 
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Note: docker-credential-gcr is primarily intended for users wishing to
authenticate with GCR in the absence of gcloud, though they are not mutually
exclusive. For normal development setups, users are encouraged to use gcloud
auth configure-docker, instead.
