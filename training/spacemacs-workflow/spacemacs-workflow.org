#+TITLE: Spacemacs Workflow
#+AUTHOR: Stephen Heywood


* Objective

By following two users, Alex and Sam we will see how they use Spacemacs and GitLab on a number of tasks.

This document will walk through a number of workflow scenarios using a number of diagrams to show key steps in sequence while working with Spacemacs and GitLab.
Each diagram shows a series of events that happen in sequence by placing them at a lower position on the diagram, i.e. time flows down the diagram.

To keep the following introduction easy for new users to Spacemacs and GitLab the version numbers shown are not technically correct but still cover the general idea of having a history for any work saved to the history log.

* Initial file edit/save

Alex has a document that they want to update and then save.

* Sync work to GitLab

With the changes saved, Alex now needs to sync the changes to GitLab.

* Issue when trying to sync work to GitLab

At a later stage, Alex is again trying to sync another set of local changes to GitLab.
The issue now is that GitLab has a been updated with a different history and files which Alex doesn't have on his computer, therefore when trying to sync to GitLab it will now fail.
We will solve this issue in the next section.
